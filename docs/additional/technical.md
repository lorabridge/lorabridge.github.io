| Title  | Type  | Year  | Link/DOI  | Abstract (shortened) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LoRaWAN Range Extender for Industrial IoT  | Journal  | 2019  | [Link](https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2019.2958620) | In this article, an innovative LoRaWAN range extender (based on an enhanced LoRaWAN node) is described, and its integration in the infrastructure of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-enabled industrial wireless networks is presented. A frame relay strategy is suggested, thus avoiding to tradeoff the highest data rates against an increased sensitivity.  |
